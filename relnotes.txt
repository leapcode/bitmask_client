ANNOUNCING Bitmask, the internet encryption toolkit, release 0.3.3

The  LEAP  team  is  pleased  to  announce the immediate availability of
version  0.3.3  of  Bitmask,  the  Internet Encryption Toolkit, codename
"the calm after the tempest".

https://downloads.leap.se/client/

LEAP  (LEAP  Encryption  Access  Project)  develops  a  plan  to  secure
everyday communication, breaking down into discrete services.

Bitmask  is the desktop client to connect to the services offered by the
LEAP   Platform.  In  the  current  phase  the  supported  services  are
Encrypted Internet Proxy and Encrypted Mail.

The   Encrypted   Internet   Proxy   provides   circumvention,  location
anonymization,  and  traffic  encryption in a hassle-free, automatically
self-configuring fashion.

Encrypted  Mail  offers  automatic  encryption  and  decryption for both
outgoing  and  incoming  email,  adding  public key cryptography to your
mail  without  you  ever  having  to  worry  about  key  distribution or
signature verification.

You  can  read  about this and many other cool things in the user manual
and the developer notes, which can be found online at:

http://bitmask.rtfd.org/

WARNING:  This is still part of a beta release of our software, a lot of
testing  and  auditing  is  still  needed, so indeed use it, and feed us
back,  fork  it  and  contribute to its development, but by any means DO
NOT trust your life to it (yet!).

WHAT CAN THIS VERSION OF BITMASK DO FOR ME?

Bitmask  0.3.3 is mostly a bugfix release, with some minor improvements.
On this release, we have fixed many UI bugs, and have undergone internal
reorganizations in the code. This release also bumps the requirement for
Soledad,  the encrypted data syncronization engine behind Bitmask, which
has  experienced  a  backward-incompatible  change. You can refer to the
CHANGELOG for the meat.

As  always,  you  can  connect  to  the Encrypted Internet Proxy service
offered  by  a  provider  of your choice, and enjoy a encrypted internet
connection that the spying eyes can only track back to your provider.

The  Encrypted  Mail services will run local SMTP and IMAP proxies that,
once  you  configure  the mail client of your choice, will automatically
encrypt and decrypt your email using GPG encryption under the hood.

If  it is the first time you run Bitmask, the first run wizard will help
you  registering  an  user  with your selected provider, downloading all
the config files needed to connect to the various LEAP services.

LICENSE

You  may use Bitmask under the GNU General Public License, version 3 or,
at  your option, any later version. See the file "LICENSE" for the terms
of the GNU General Public License, version 3.

In  addition,  as  a  special  exception,  the  copyright  holders  give
permission  to  link  the  code  of  portions  of  this program with the
OpenSSL   library   under   certain  conditions  as  described  in  each
individual  source  file,  and  distribute linked combinations including
the two.

INSTALLATION

We  distribute  the current version of Bitmask as standalone bundles for
GNU/Linux  and  OSX,  but it is likely that you are able to run it under
other systems, specially if you are skillful and patience is one of your
virtues.

Have a look at "docs/user/install.rst".

Packages will be soon provided for debian and ubuntu, and the release of
windows bundles will be resumed shortly.

We  will  love  to  hear  if  you are interested in help making packages
available for any other system.

BUGS

You  can  send  the bugs our way by pointing your telnet session to port
443  on  https://leap.se/code.  We  will do our best to make them follow
our intensive bug-reeducation program.

HACKING

You can find us in the #leap-dev channel on the freenode network.

If  you  are lucky enough, you can also spot us drinking mate, sleepless
in  night  trains,  rooftops,  rainforests,  lonely islands and, always,
beyond any border.
