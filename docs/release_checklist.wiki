= Bitmask Release Checklist =

  == CI check ==
  * [ ] Check that all tests are passing!
  * [ ] Fix any broken tests.

  == Version bumps and Tagging ==

  * [ ] Update release-notes.rst in leap.bitmask if needed.
  * [ ] Update version in bitmask_client/pkg/linux/bitmask-root if needed.

    * [ ] export version: export RELEASE=0.9.0
    * [ ] git checkout `release/0.9.x`
	- NOTE: the release branch is created when the first release candidate
	  is tagged, after that the bugfixes and features that are meant to be
	  shipped with the specific version that we are targetting are merged in that branch
    * [ ] git checkout -b release/$RELEASE (this is a LOCAL branch, never published).
 	* [ ] (maybe) cherry-pick specific commits
	* [ ] (maybe) add special fixes for this release

    * [ ] Review pkg/requirements.pip for everything, update if needed (that's why the order).
          - See whatever has been introduced in changes/VERSION_COMPAT
          - Reset changes/VERSION_COMPAT
          - Bump all the leap-requirements altogether.
    * [ ] git commit -am "Update requirements file"

    * [ ] Merge changes/next-changelog.rst into the CHANGELOG
          - NOTE: in leap.soledad, 3 sections (common, client, server).
    * [ ] reset changes/next-changelog.rst
    * [ ] git commit -S -m "[pkg] Update changelog"

    * [ ] git tag --sign $RELEASE -m "Tag version $RELEASE"

    * If everything went ok, push the changes, and merge back into master&develop:

    	* [ ] git push origin release/0.9.x
        * [ ] git push origin $RELEASE
