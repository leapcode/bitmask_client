= Bitmask Release Checklist (*) =
  * [ ] Check that all tests are passing!
  * [ ] Tag everything
    * Should be done for the following packages, in order:
      1. leap.common
      2. leap.keymanager
      3. leap.soledad
      4. leap.mail
      5. leap.bitmask
      6. leap.mx
    * NOTE: It's assumed that origin is the leap.se repo
    * [ ] git fetch origin
    * [ ] git tag -l, and see the latest tagged version (unless it's not a minor version bump, in which case, just bump to it)
    * [ ] Checkout release-X.Y.Z (locally, never pushed)
    * [ ] Fold in changes files into the CHANGELOG
      - NOTE: For leap.soledad, the CHANGELOG entries should be divided per package (common, client, server). See older releases for reference.
      - Helper bash line: for i in $(ls changes); do cat changes/$i; echo; done
    * [ ] Update relnotes.txt if needed.
    * [ ] git rm changes/*
    * [ ] git commit -av
    * [ ] Review pkg/requirements.pip for everything and update if needed (that's why the order).
      - See whatever has been introduced in changes/VERSION_COMPAT
      - Reset changes/VERSION_COMPAT
    * [ ] git tag -s X.Y.Z (note the -s so that it's a signed tag) The message should be something like: Tag <package> version X.Y.Z
    * [ ] git push origin X.Y.Z
    * [ ] git checkout master && git pull origin master && git merge release-X.Y.Z && git push origin master
    * [ ] git checkout develop && git pull origin develop && git merge release-X.Y.Z && git push origin develop
  * [ ] Build and upload bundles
    * [ ] Use the scripts under pkg/<os>/ to build the the bundles.
    * [ ] Sign them with gpg -a <path/to/bundle>
    * [ ] Upload bundle and signature to web-uploads@salmon.leap.se:~/public/client/<os>/
    * [ ] Update symbolic link for latest upload and signature:
    	* [ ] ~/public/client/<os>latest-<ver>
    	* [ ] ~/public/client/<os>latest-<ver>.asc
  * [ ] Announce
    * [ ] Mail leap@lists.riseup.net
